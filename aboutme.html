                <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>I am an ambitious, energetic, and outgoing sixteen year old, and I am currently working on my High School Diploma. Over the past 16 years of my life I have acquired many valuable skills and I have learned many valuable lessons, through volunteering in the areas of pet care, assisting young kids and keeping them engaged while volunteering at the Children's Discovery Museum, cleaning and washing towels at a barber shop. 
        <h2><p>I have many hobbies such as traveling, hiking, mountain biking, and rock climbing. I greatly appreciate different cultures and the cultural diversity between different parts of the world. This summer I traveled to Utah, where I went mountain biking, and had the opportunity to hike and summit Manns Peak which was a 27.3 mile hike uphill. I am very proud of my accomplishments in life, in the future I would like to become a Psychologist, I have always enjoyed being able to lend a hand when others need one, and throughout my life I have experienced multiple moments where I am filled with great satisfaction and happiness, when I am able to help others find their purpose and true worth, and I would like to continue doing so as a career.

        <li><h4>If you want something done, ask a busy person! I find gratification in accomplishing more than less, so I prefer to take on a little more. It’s better than handling only one issue at a time. I’ve learned to batch tasks so that I’m focusing on similar activities at the same time. That way, I don’t lose time and focus when I switch tasks.</li>
